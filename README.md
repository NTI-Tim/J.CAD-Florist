## Configuration of GitHub Pages

In this project, GitHub Pages is used as a staging area to easily present completed features to the customer. Pages are also used to easily test parts of the website on different devices.

1. Log in to github.com.
2. Open the J.CAD-FLORIST repository.
3. Navigate to "Settings."
4. Select the "Pages" tab under "Code and automation."
5. Ensure that "Source" under "Build and deployment" is set to "Deploy from a branch."
6. Under "Branch," select "live" and "/ (root)."
7. Then click "Save."

---

## Update GitHub Pages Site

Github Pages is built from the `live` branch.
All completed changes should be pushed to the `main` branch. 
When a feature is fully finished, it should be merged or rebased into the `live` branch.

## Web Server

### How to Access the Web Server

The web server is used to publish features that the product owner has approved as fully complete so they can be used by the customer.

1. Open a command prompt and type:
```bash
ssh root@<ip> -p <port>
```
2. Type `yes` if prompted.
3. When prompted, enter the password.
4. After having entered the server navigate to the correct directory:
```bash
cd /var/www/html
```
5. If the directory is empty:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/J.CAD-Florist .
```

---

### How to Switch to a New Version

While located at `/var/www/html`, run:

```bash
git fetch
git checkout <your tag>
```

You can list all tags by typing:

```bash
git tag
```

## Installing and Running Flask

\(For a comprehensive guide to Flask, refer to [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)\)

The website backend is built through [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/projects/flask/), a Python-based web framework.

### Python Virtual Environment

To run the website, all dependencies for it need to be installed.
This can be done through a Python virtual environment, which ensures that all Python packages that are installed via `pip` will be containerized inside of the virtual environment, instead of globally on the system.
First, create a Python virtual environment:

``python -m venv venv``

To source and enter the created virtual environment if you are on windows, run:

``venv\Scripts\activate``

or if you are on macOS, Linux, or another unix-based operating system, run:

``source venv/bin/activate``

Once having sourced the virtual environment, `(venv)` will appear to the left of your prompt on the command line.
To exit the virtual environment, simply run `exit` on the command line.

### Install Dependencies

After having created and entered the Python virtual environment, you can install the necessary dependencies to be able to run the Flask application.
The file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains the Python packages necessary for the project.
To install the packages, run the following in the root directory of the project:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

### Update Dependencies

After installing additional packages for the project, ensure that requirements.txt is updated by running:

``pip freeze > requirements.txt``

### Run Development Server

To start a development Flask server for the website, run:

``flask run``

This will start the server on a specific port, which is then printed on the console.
To change the port that the server runs on, edit the value of `FLASK_RUN_PORT` in the [.flaskenv](.flaskenv) file.

## Overview of the Flask Application

The Python file `florista.py` located in the root directory is the main file that is executed when running `flask run`, and in turn imports everything from the `app/` directory.
The `app/` directory contains all the files and directories which the website uses, and is treated by Flask as a Python package when imported.
This is due to the `__init__.py` located in it, which initializes the `app` package and configures various things at startup.

Inside of the `app/` directory are various files directories which perform different functions for the website.

### Routes and Templates

`routes.py` describes the routes for the website.
It contains functions which are interpreted and return at different routes, or pathways of the website.
This can be static or template HTML files, but also for instance files or redirects to other functions inside of `routes.py`.
The `@app.route` decorators set before the function definitions specify pathways for the site where the functions will be interpreted.
For instance, setting `@app.route('/index')` before a function will set the function to be interpreted after navigating to `<url-of-site>/index` in your browser.
Setting `@app.route('/')` before a function will set it as the default function to run when entering the root url of the site.
Multiple `@app.route` decorators can be set before a function definition.

The `templates/` directory contains the template HTML files used for the website.
Templates can contain placeholders for dynamic information which gets sent from the Flask server.
[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) is the templating engine used for this project.
It can process variables sent via Flask to the templates, which are sent in the return statements of the functions in `routes.py`.
Following is an example function:

```
@app.route('/en')
def en():
    lang = "en"
    return render_template('index.html', lang=lang)
```

The above funct√≠on will render the file `index.html` located at `templates/` and send the variable `lang` into `index.html` where it can be processed through Jinja.
Putting `{{ lang }}` inside of the HTML file will replace that with the variable value when the page is rendered, in this case with "en".

The file `base.html` in `templates/` is used to create a base structure to include in other template files.
`{% extends "base.html" %}` is included at the top of every new template file to define `base.html` as the master template that the template inherits from.
`{% block content %}{% endblock %}` is set inside of `base.html` to define where the content of the template files should be put inside of `base.html`.
All the content within the template files then have to be defined as:

```
{% block content %}
<content>
{% endblock %}
```

where `<content>` is replaced with the actual HTML content.

### Database and Migrations

The project uses an sqlite database, which is manipulated through the SQLAlchemy Python toolkit.

`models.py` describes models used to create tables for the database.
It consists of class definitions that act as schemas for creating database tables.
Following is a simple example model definition:

```bash
import sqlalchemy as sa
import sqlalchemy.orm as so
from app import db

class TempInfo(db.Model):
    id: so.Mapped[int] = so.mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    test: so.Mapped[str] = so.mapped_column(sa.String(32), index=True, unique=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<TempInfo {}>'.format(self.test)
```

The project uses the `flask-migrate` Python package to handle database migrations.
Migrations simplify the act of changing the database as new models and/or changes to the models are added.
It ensures that the database does not need to be recreated each time a change is made.
The `migrations/` directory located at the root directory contains the database migrations information, which is already present in the source tree.
If needing to initialize a new database migrations repository, `flask db init` would be run.

After creating a new database model, run the following after switching out `<message>` for an appropriate description of what has been changed:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "<message>"
```

This will create database migrations for the added models.
To apply the changes to the database, run:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

This will modify the `app.db` sqlite database file located in `app/`.
You can also run `flask db downgrade`, to downgrade to a previous version of the database migrations.
More info about migrations can be found [here](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

After having updated the database migrations and database, you can start creating tables from the models to the database.
Adding to or changing the database can be done in different ways.
It can be done through the site itself by using [web forms](#web-forms), or manually on the command line.
To add data directly through the command line, first run `flask shell` to enter a Python shell.
Then replace the example table model and data with the actual model and data in the following code and then paste it into the shell:

```bash
tableRow = TempInfo(test="testing")
db.session.add(tableRow)
db.session.commit()
```

To go through and query the rows in a table, run:

```bash
query = sa.select(TempInfo)
tempInfo = db.session.scalars(query)
for table in tempInfo:
    print(table.id, table.test)
```

### Web Forms

The file `forms.py` consists of classes that define forms for the website.
The classes can then be used to populate forms inside HTML templates by sending forms through `routes.py`.
Forms can be used to change database information through the site itself, and for instance create a login and sign up interface for the website.

### Static

The `static/` directory contains various subdirectories containing static files used for the website.
`static/css/` contains the various CSS files used for styling of the website.
`static/js/` contains the JavaScript files used for frontend scripting on the website.
`static/images/` contains all the images which are used on the website.

### Config

`config.py` sets various configurations used by the Flask application.
It defines the class `Config` which contains variables used by Flask.

### Changing Shell Context

Running `flask shell` starts a Python shell with various predefined objects sourced form the project.
`florista.py` contains a definition of function `make_shell_context()` that contains a return statement for a Python dictionary containing key-value pairs to define objects that should be present in the shell.
To add new objects to be present by default when running `flask shell`.
For instance, the key-value pair `'db': db` will initialize `'db'` to return the object `db` in the shell.

## Website Content Tests

The project uses tests to verify the content of the website. The various test files are located in the [tests](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/J.CAD-Florist/tree/main/tests) directory.
To run tests for the website, Python 3.12.5 is required, which can be installed at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/).

Then, open the project in a command prompt and run these commands:

```bash
pip install playwright lxml
```

```bash
python -m playwright install
```

To configure the tests, go to view --> testing --> configure python tests --> unittests --> tests.

There is also a Python script that generates screenshots of the website. This script can be run by typing `python .\tests\screenshots.py`.

---

## Image Resolutions

This page uses a script to create variations of images in different resolutions to optimize loading times. For this, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is required.

Once Node.js is installed, the following command should be run in the project's root directory:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install all packages required to run the project.

If there is a need to create all images again (e.g., if new resolutions or images have been added), run the following command:
```bash
npm run resize
```
