# Code Analysis

To validate the HTML and CSS code, we use the VS Code extension W3C Web Validator.

Search for the extension ID “CelianRiboulet.webvalidator” in the extensions in VS Code to find it.
After installation, a small button will appear in the bottom-left corner (W3C validation).
This will list all the errors in the 'problems' section inside the terminal.
